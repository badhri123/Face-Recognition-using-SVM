1.This set of programs will learn to classify between faces of two different people.
2.The algorithm used is Support vector machines with kernels.
3.SVM_Linear kernel uses linear kernel method and SVM_Gaussiankernel uses Gaussian kernel method.
4.gkernel is a function which will give as output the similarity between two feature vectors in a gaussain distribution form.
5.costone and costzero are functions of cost used by the main programs.
6.face1 and face2 are the data used for two different people respectively.

To-do

1. Open the SVM_Linear kernel file and run it.Check the accuracy of prediction.
2.Open the SVM_GaussianKernel file and run it.Check the accuracy of prediction.
